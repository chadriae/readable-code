# Readable code

## Learning Objectives

- To be able to make decisions about when and how to refactor less readable code.
- To be able to adhere to known PHP code standards like PSR2.
- To be able to think critically about code principles and not follow them blindly.

## Questions

1. First is to try to understand the code
2. What can I change to make it more readable?
3. Are there unnecessary parts of code?
4. Can I rewrite parts of code to make it more readable or to make the functions easier to understand?
5. If I change code, will it break the code?

## Steps

After analyzing the code, I could get started with the first step. I had an idea of what the code did and I studied it step by step.
These are the steps I took to make the code more readable and easier to understand:

1. Made a new php file called cleanedup.php
2. Renamed all functions and variables to more readable and understandable names
3. Got rid of all dead and test code
4. Implementend a switch operator in stead of all the if-else statements
5. Made a seperate function to determine address
6. Wrote just one function to make everyone happy
